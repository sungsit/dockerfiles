# Debian 8.1 (Thai mirror)

Because HTTPREDIR <http://httpredir.debian.org/> is not fast enough for me when install packages locally. The only difference from Docker official image is a mirror `sources.list` file. You don't need this image unless you've been living in Thailand and want to build new image locally.
